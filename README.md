# GoogleFoobarChallenges
My Google FooBar challenges!  

Google Foobar is a secret set of programming challenges made by Google to find people they might consider hiring. They get progressively harder as you go through the levels and every challenge has a time limit to complete it. Additionally, each challenge needs to run in a state that is optimized enough so that it can run on Google's system fast enough.  

It was very fun! You can get an invite if Google has noticed a pattern in your search history that indicates you are a developer. Once they have noticed this, they will sent an invite at the top of a search page asking if you want to play a game, click yes and you get an invite!.  

You can see the challenges and my solutions in this repository, I would recommend not copying these and trying them on your own, but the internet is there for a reason, so use it if you really need help!
